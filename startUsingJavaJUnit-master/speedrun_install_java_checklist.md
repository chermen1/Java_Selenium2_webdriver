# Windows Install Speedrun checklist

## Install Java Pre-requisites - Install Java Speedrun on Windows

* `[ ]` Check what you need to install by typing console commands
    * `[ ]` "javac -version"
          - if it fails install java jdk
    * `[ ]` "mvn -version"
          - if it fails install maven

---

* `[ ]` Download Java
    * `[ ]` search for "download java sdk" (do not install the normal JRE from java.com)
         - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

---

* `[ ]` Install Java JDK
    * `[ ]` Windows
        - e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_102`
        * `[ ]` add the Java "\bin" folder to the path if it hasn't been added
           e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_102\bin`
        * `[ ]` create a JAVA_HOME environment variable while there for the root path
            e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_102`
            - some people add a `JDK_HOME` for the root path as well (I haven't done this)
        * `[ ]` check Java JDK installed by typing `javac -version` in a new command line

---

* `[ ]` Install Maven
    * `[ ]` Download Maven http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation
    * `[ ]` Windows
        * `[ ]` Unzip maven to a directory (avoid one with spaces in it)
            - e.g. `C:\maven_3_3_9`
        * `[ ]` add `C:\maven_3_3_9\bin` to the `PATH` in System Variables
        * `[ ]` check installed by typing `mvn -version` into a new command window

---

* `[ ]` everything is installed, check the environment variables by displaying them on the console
    * `[ ]` Windows
        * `[ ]` `echo %JAVA_HOME%`
        * `[ ]` `echo %PATH%`

---

* `[ ]` Download JUnit Test Project (this has a simple pom.xml and a basic test to run)
    * `[ ]` visit https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingJavaJUnit
    * `[ ]` download the zip file and unzip somewhere

* `[ ]` run my first test from the command line
    * `[ ]` use the command line to "cd" to the directory you unarchived the source code to
    * `[ ]` `mvn test`

If it runs successfully then you have Java and Maven Installed in Windows.

---

## Install IntelliJ for Java  - Install IntelliJ Java Speedrun on Windows


* `[ ]`  download IntelliJ Community Edition from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea
* `[ ]`  install it

---

* `[ ]`  create new project from existing sources
* `[ ]`  open the `pom.xml` from the folder that we  placed the downloads from https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingJavaJUnit
* `[ ]`  we may need to configure IntelliJ to use the Java SDK we installed earlier, if so, follow the IntelliJ prompts
    * `[ ]` you may need to tell intellij where the SDK is,
        - use the project settings to create an new SDK config
          using the `JAVA_HOME` path above
* `[ ]`  right click on the test and 'run' the test
* `[ ]`  if it passes it means that Java, Maven, IntelliJ are all now installed and ready to use
